                The small village of Mfoa, gaining importance with the establishment of a mission by the Spiritans, was
                erected in 1911 by the colonial administration as the commune of Brazzaville.
                It is named after the Italian-French explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. A first city hall was built in
                1912 which was replaced in 1962-1963 by the current city hall.
                Its first coherent urban planning dates from 1929 under Governor General Antonetti.
